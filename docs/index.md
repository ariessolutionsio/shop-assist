## Features

Shop Assist is a commercetools custom application that integrates directly into the Merchant Center. It enables companies to support their customers by managing carts efficiently. Built with flexibility in mind, it can be extended and customized to fit specific business requirements.

### Cart Management Overview

The main dashboard provides a **list of carts** associated with the project. The list is displayed in a **table format** with pagination controls. Users can:

- Adjust the **number of items per page**.
- Customize **visible columns** to display only the most relevant data.
- Use the **search bar** to quickly find carts.

#### Searching for Carts

By default, users can search by:

- **Cart ID**
- **Customer Email Address**

The searchable fields can be adjusted to fit business needs.

        <source src="assets/search-carts.webm" type="video/webm">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

#### Viewing and Editing Carts

Clicking on a cart opens the **Cart Details** page. This view provides:

- **Line Item Details** – Full breakdown of products in the cart.
- **Cart Summary** – Displays totals, tax calculations, and applied discounts.
- **Cart Status** – Indicates whether the cart is open, ordered, or abandoned.

#### Cart Modifications

Users can modify carts in several ways:

- **Add Items** – Search for and add products directly to the cart.
- **Remove Items** – Delete individual line items from the cart.
- **Adjust Quantities** – Modify the quantity of existing items.
- **Apply Discounts** – Manually apply discounts at the cart level.

### Customization & Extensibility

Shop Assist is designed to be tailored to each company's needs. Businesses can:

- Configure which **columns** are shown in the cart list.
- Adjust **searchable fields**.
- Extend functionality with **custom actions and integrations**.
